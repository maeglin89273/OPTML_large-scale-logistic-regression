# Large-scale Logistic Regression
Project from Optimization and Machine Learning course. It implements Newton method and gradient descent to solve a large scale logistic regression problem in Matlab. The feature size and the data size of the dataset are up to ten million. The speed and the accuracy are camparable to the result from libsvm. 
* Dataset: [kdd2010 (bridge to algebra)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html)
* Implemented in Matlab
